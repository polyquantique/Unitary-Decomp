"""# Unitary Decompositions

This package provides functions to decompose and approximate linear optical transformations into various interferometer configurations.

The available decompositions include:

- **Clements Interferometer**: Decomposes a unitary matrix into a rectangular mesh of beam splitters and phase shifters.

- **Bell Interferometer**: Decomposes a unitary matrix into a rectangular mesh of symmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometers.

- **LPLM Interferometer**: Decomposes a unitary matrix into a sequence of 6N + 1 phase masks interleaved with discrete Fourier transforms.

- **Fourier Interferometer**: Decomposes a unitary matrix into a sequence of 4N + 1 or 2N+5 phase masks interleaved with discrete Fourier transforms.

For more details on each decomposition, refer to the respective module documentation.
