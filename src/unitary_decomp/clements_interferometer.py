# Clements interferometer module.

This module provides functions to perform the decomposition of unitary matrices into a mesh of beam splitters and phase shifters, as well as to reconstruct the unitary matrix from the decomposition.
This algorithm can be used to configure universal multiport interferometers based on the design of Clements *et al*. (2016).

The main functions are:
- `beam_splitter`: Returns the matrix form of a parametric beam splitter acting on two consecutive channels in a multi-mode circuit. Unit cell used in the paper by Clements *et al*.
- `mzi_matrix`: Returns the exact matrix form of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with an external phase shifter acting on two consecutive channels in a multi-mode circuit.
- `clements_decomposition`: Decomposes a unitary matrix into a sequence of beam splitters (`beam_splitter`) and a diagonal unitary matrix of single-mode phase-shifts.
- `mzi_decomposition`: Decomposes a unitary matrix into a sequence of Mach-Zehnder interferometers (`mzi_matrix`) and a diagonal unitary matrix of single-mode phase-shifts.
- `circuit_reconstruction`: Reconstructs the unitary matrix from the decomposition obtained with `clements_decomposition`.
- `mzi_circuit_reconstruction`: Reconstructs the unitary matrix from the decomposition obtained with `mzi_decomposition`.
