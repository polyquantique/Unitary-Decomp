# LPLM Interferometer Module

This module provides functions to perform the López Pastor, Lundeen and Marquardt (LPLM) decomposition of a unitary matrix into a sequence of phase masks interleaved with discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) matrices.
It includes functions to generate the necessary mask sequences, extract layer parameters from a Clements decomposition, and reconstruct the unitary matrix from its decomposition.
The algorithm works for unitary matrices of even dimension and generates a sequence of 6N + 1 phase masks for a unitary matrix of dimension N.
For more details on the LPLM decomposition, see references [1] and [2].
