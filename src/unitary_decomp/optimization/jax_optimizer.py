# JAX Optimizer

This module provides functions to optimize a sequence of phase masks to approximate a target unitary matrix using JAX.
The linear interferometer is modeled as a neural network which is trained to learn a target unitary matrix by
adjusting the phase masks. The optimization is performed using the Adam optimizer with multiple restarts to find
the best set of parameters. The module consists of the following main functions:

- `forward_product`: Computes the forward product of the network given a sequence of phase masks and a mixing layer.
- `infidelity_loss_function`: Computes the infidelity loss function between the target unitary and the approximated unitary.
- `adam_run`: Runs the Adam optimizer for a given number of steps to optimize the angles in the phase masks.
- `jax_mask_optimizer`: Main function to optimize the phase masks to approximate a target unitary matrix.
- `scipy_mask_optimizer`: Similar to `jax_mask_optimizer`, but uses the BFGS algorithm from SciPy for optimization.
