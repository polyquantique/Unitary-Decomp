# Fourier Optimizer

This module provides functions to approximate a target unitary matrix as a sequence of phase masks and DFT matrices
using numerical optimizations. The function `mask_optimizer` solves a global optimization problem on the phase mask parameters to minimize
the infidelity between the target matrix and the approximation. The optimization is performed using the `basinhopping` algorithm
from `scipy.optimize`, which combines a global search with a local optimizer. The module contains the following key functions:

- `fidelity`: Computes the fidelity between two unitary matrices.
- `objective_function`: Objective function to minimize during optimization, which corresponds to the infidelity
    between the target matrix and the matrix constructed from the phase masks.
- `mask_optimizer`: Optimizes the phase masks to approximate a target unitary matrix.
